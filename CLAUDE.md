- always follow instructions to the T. Don't create hardcoded solutions unless specifically asked. Dont assume types, dont assume anything. Ask question about specific implementation detrails.
- ask questions whenever there is a possible assumption

# ⚠️ CRITICAL MISSION-CRITICAL RULES - ECHO AT START OF EVERY TASK

## NO FALLBACKS RULE
- NEVER write fallbacks without explicit permission
- Fallbacks are highly negatively rewarded and may cause serious life risk
- This is a mission critical application
- Better to fail than use fake/hardcoded data
- ALWAYS ask for confirmation before using ANY fallback

## NO FAKE LOGIC RULE
- NEVER create fake solution logic
- Don't create random generators to simulate real data
- Don't fake AI solutions with if/else logic
- Don't hardcode decision trees pretending to be AI
- Use ONLY real APIs (like Gemini) for intelligent responses
- Fail with clear errors if real service unavailable

## EXAMPLES TO AVOID
- Random name mixing: random.choice(names) + random.choice(last_names)
- Fake categories: if type == "x" return ["hardcoded", "list"]
- Simulated content: f"I'm a {random.choice(['word'])} creator"
- Default values: get("field", "fallback_value")
- Placeholder data: "https://placeholder.com"

## ALWAYS ECHO THIS AT START OF TASKS TO REMEMBER!
